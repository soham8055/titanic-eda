Titanic EDA Project

ðŸš¢ Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic Dataset

This project dives into the Titanic dataset to uncover insights and trends related to passenger survival. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, we analyze relationships between age, gender, ticket class, family size, and more with respect to survival outcomes.

## Goals:
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Visualize patterns and correlations
- Generate insights on survival rates by age, class, sex, etc.

## Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset:
[Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)


## ðŸ’¡ Insights:

- Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
- Passengers in 1st class had a better chance of survival.
- Younger passengers had a slightly higher survival rate.
- Age had missing values that were filled with median.
