# Titanic EDA Project ðŸš¢

This project explores the Titanic dataset from the famous Kaggle competition to understand factors affecting passenger survival.

## Goals:
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Visualize patterns and correlations
- Generate insights on survival rates by age, class, sex, etc.

## Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset:
[Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)


## ðŸ’¡ Insights:

- Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
- Passengers in 1st class had a better chance of survival.
- Younger passengers had a slightly higher survival rate.
- Age had missing values that were filled with median.
